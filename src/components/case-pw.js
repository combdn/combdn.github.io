            After the first discussion with the team, I came up with the concept
            that was based on how similar tasks (mostly one-direction data flow
            with some logic) are handled in VFX industry: i.¬†e. boxes connected
            with wires.

              This concept was created in the first two days. We had an XML
              file, and I already had a good reference for the node-based
              systems (SideFX Houdini).

          <p>
            Some of the decisions were to be revisited, but the concept was
            accepted by both the team and the client.

              Initial workflow concept was created during the workshops with the

              Currently, the tool allows using decorated Python functions as
              building blocks to perform ETL operations, to run models with
              resulting data, and to save results of the models‚Äô runs.

          <p>
            The data and execution flows are separated to ensure the exact order
            of the computations and to enable error events handling. There‚Äôs a
            special trigger node to configure the conditions for the job start
            (and also chain them), and an exit node to handle the various
            possible outcomes. There are also Data Source and Data Destination
            node types to work with databases and a filesystem.

            The other tool is dedicated to running the created jobs in HPC (CUDA

            This tool includes debugging and introspection features that allow
            seeing the journal of execution for any job. Users can review each
