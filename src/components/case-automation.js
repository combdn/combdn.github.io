            The current automation software mostly focuses on controlling
            individual winches that drive various stage machinery: lifting
            trusses, moving theatrical scenery and LED screens, rotating
            platforms, and many others. But when it is required to put together
            a device that can [safely] fly objects or even people on complex
            trajectories, orchestrate complex synchronized movements, you are
            mostly out of luck. (It is possible but very nontrivial, to say the
            least.)

            Most of the software and hardware (they are hardware/software
            combinations most of the time) try to use a single interface to
            handle both design and execution. But I‚Äôve found it very limiting:
            sometimes even common operations require jumping through the hoops.
            The idea was to split the interface into two, so you could design on
            a generic PC with a regular keyboard and a mouse, and execute with a
            specialized console with hardware controls.

          <p>
            Since I had little experience with the execution part (we planned to
            catch up on that later with our client), I decided to proceed with
            the design interface. After submerging myself in the field, I‚Äôve
            found that it closely resembles VFX with two differences: everything
            is connected to hardware, and you don‚Äôt get to plan an exact timing.
            With that in mind, I came up with several ideas.

            The next step was to prototype some of the ideas. Due to
            similarities to the VFX field, I used Houdini procedural environment
            both as a reference and as a tool for creating some mockups.

              Of course, to cope with rocking and inertia, you need a physical
              simulation, but at that point, I was trying to shift the focus to
              working with the rig as a whole instead of taking care of
              individual winches.
            </p>

            <p>
              The next prototype was to demonstrate the notion of a parametrized
              asset (again an idea from the CAD/Houdini world) ‚Äî a pre-made
              thing that you could utilize out of the box tweaking its settings
              to fit your task. Since most of the shows use a similar set of
              tricks, having a selection of such assets at hand could solve 90%
              of everyday problems.

              Having several ideas about automation, I started thinking about
              lighting. The current situation with lighting consoles is much
              better than the one with automation counterparts, but I was just
              curious to put together some more prototypes made in a procedural
              fashion.

            When it came to showing this to industry professionals, some of the
            concepts were taken with a grain of salt. But they were excited by
            the idea of having a single piece of software that could connect the
            video, audio, lights, and automation under one roof and interlink
            them in an adaptive procedural way. (Reusable assets demo was a
            particular success üôÇ.)
